## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

### [Project 1: Bank Marketing Term Deposit Subscription Prediction](https://github.com/Akbar-fitriawan/bank_dopositTerm_prediction)
This project aims to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on data from a bank's marketing campaign. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze customer data and campaign outcomes to build predictive models for binary classification.

### [Project 2: Predicting Car Insurance Claims](https://github.com/Akbar-fitriawan/Akbar-fitriawan-Insurance-Claims-Overs-Cars)
A machine learning project to predict the likelihood of car insurance claims using various classification algorithms. This project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.



<!--### [Project 2: Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Project2)
A clustering project to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using K-means and hierarchical clustering. The project includes exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and clustering evaluation.

### [Project 3: Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Project3)
A natural language processing project to analyze customer sentiment from product reviews using text mining and sentiment analysis techniques. The project covers text preprocessing, vectorization, model building, and sentiment scoring.
